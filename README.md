# Distractable Blog

This is the [Hyde](https://github.com/lakshmivyas/hyde) project for my personal blog, [distractable](http://distractable.net/).  

In addition to being a site generated with Hyde, the blog sits behind an [AppEngine](http://appengine.google.com/) [Go](http://golang.org/) page to serve the pages which static files are served through AppEngines `static_files` functionality. I'm just getting started with Go though, so don't expect anything too amazing and there is still a lot to do using memcache, etc.

In addition to this repository, I have started the [Gopherhide](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/gopherhide) repository which should be a great starting place for anyone wanting to setup a similar site.
