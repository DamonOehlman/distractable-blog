{% excerpt %}

About 6 months ago (I think...) I converted this blog from a Wordpress driven solution to a 
static site built with the excellent static generator, [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).
I was in heaven.  I could write my blog posts in [Markdown](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Markdown)
and in general feel more productive when blogging.  Though recently, I've taken a turn to the 
dark-side of static site generators in Jekyll's alter ego, [Hyde](https://github.com/lakshmivyas/hyde).

## Jekyll

Full credit goes to [Tom Preston-Werner](http://twitter.com/#!/mojombo) for Jekyll.  It's lightweight,
works well and does exactly what it says on the box.  It is, however, written in Ruby.  
Now us "non-Ruby developers" really do owe a debt of gratitude to those who do tinker with that
shiny red gem of a language, as in general, they have raised the bar on tooling in a number of areas.
Static website generation being one of them.

In general, Jekyll does an excellent job of creating a static site from a variety of input formats. You 
can write pages in Markdown, Textile (and others) and with some YAML front-matter have a pretty intelligent
page created.  

Also, the amount of [documentation around migrating to Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Blog-Migrations)
is impressive. 

All in all, Jekyll is an excellent solution if you are looking for a simple static site generator.

## Hyde

Hyde, while inspired by Jekyll does things slightly differently.  While Jekyll's preferred approach is to 
convert and process all the folders within a directory (with the exception of special `_` folders), Hyde
will only parse the files stored within the designated `content` directory.

These content files are parsed through Hyde's processing engine and then pushed into a `deploy` folder
along with files from a `media` folder.  The processing engine uses the [Django template language](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/)
to process the files against templates stored in a `layout` folder.

The way that Hyde does this _django-like_ template processing is probably the main reason I have moved
across to it. Using the django templating engine as a core piece of the site generator means that
even those "slightly tricky things" aren't that hard to do.  Where using Jekyll I found myself
writing plugins to achieve certain outcomes, when using Hyde most things can be achieved using 
djangos templating language.  Which is pretty powerful.

Other things that set Hyde apart are:

* the seperation of the `content` and `deploy` directory which make managing the site as it 
grows simpler, IMO.

* the inclusion of pre-processors that mean you can use things like [{less}](http://lesscss.org/)
as a CSS preprocessor. Happy days :)

## Which is Right for You - Jekyll or Hyde?

For me the choice is definitely Hyde.  This is because:

* I am happy hacking around in both python and django templates
* I really, really like using {less}
* The separation the `content` directory stops me getting too confused...
* I can still use markdown through the `markdown` template tags :)


While I can't see myself using Jekyll again in the future (now I've found Hyde), I do 
think it is a great fit for those people who really want to build a site writing either pure
Markdown or Textile.  Additionally the [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) integration 
with Jekyll is very nice.  Given that Hyde generates a static site though, there is nothing
stopping you uploading that into github either.

For some, it will simply come down to a ruby vs python thing.

## Where to from here?

Well there's still a lot to learn about Hyde. It's a great solution so I'm going to continue
to use it and explore what it can do.  In terms of the blog - it's been converted across and 
is now running behind a lightweight [Go](http://golang.org/) wrapper on the 
[Google AppEngine Go Runtime](https://code.google.com/appengine/docs/go/overview.html).

The [Sidelab site](http://www.sidelab.com/) is to receive the same treatment. I'm enjoying hacking
around with Go too, but that's another post entirely...

## Update: 27 July 2011

### Website Source on Github

As per Joshua's request below, I have uploaded the source for the blog to [Github](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/distractable-blog).
Additionally, I'm going to try and maintain a skeleton Hyde + AppEngine Go site repository called
[Gopherhide](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/gopherhide) which should be a good place for those
wanting a similar setup.  In terms of the Go code, I'm just getting the hang of things, so don't 
expect wonders and there is still a lot to do (i.e. add memcache support, etc).

### Too Many Hydes

The problem with multiple personalities is, well once you have one it's difficult to stop.  It turns
out my investigation was not quite in depth enough and there is a [new version of hyde](http://hyde.github.com/) 
in active development.  The new version looks quite good and I'll definitely look at transitioning 
over to it at some stage.  Given I haven't quite finished the [Sidelab](http://www.sidelab.com/) 
conversion across to Hyde yet, I'll probably move that one across first.

Thanks to [Boris Smus](http://twitter.com/borismus) for pointing me to the new version...
