It was an interesting day today. I am currently neck-deep in a client project which makes
use of [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) in what is becoming a pretty standard kind of 
configuration for [Sidelab](http://www.sidelab.com/) projects.

While I won't go into the architecture here (I'll save that for when I finally get the Sidelab 
Blog online), I want to briefly talk about some of my experiences today with 
[leveldb](http://code.google.com/p/leveldb/).

{% endexcerpt %}

LevelDB is a pretty impressive piece of kit, IMO.  It's light, fast and simple to use. That is, if 
you want a gutsy little file-based key value store.  While it's most obvious use is probably for 
a simple [NoSQL](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/NoSQL) container, I wanted to 
do something a little different with it.

## Potential for LevelDB as a Changelog / Journal

Essentially, my thoughts were to use leveldb as a journal for updates that have been made in what we 
are designing to be a highly-available architecture. In the current application being built on the
Sidelab "nodeSTACK", we use [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) to take advantage of the excellent
[PostGIS](http://postgis.org/) for geospatial queries required for our application.

Why not just use standard Postgres master/slave replication you ask? Well that was definitely an option,
but I really want to avoid introducing a [single point of failure](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Single_point_of_failure) 
into the system architecture.  Additionally, while our level of PostgreSQL expertise is growing we
aren't a company of database administrators, so attempting to become proficient with the likes of 
[Slony-I](http://slony.info/) or [Bucardo](http://bucardo.org/) would mean taking our relationship with
Postgres to the "next level".

By using a distributed leveldb journal we could rebuild the system in event of failure, and theoretically 
distribute those journals to other machines in the system.  The concept relies on the fact that leveldb
is in fact a __sorted__ key value store and we would use high resolution timestamps coupled with a generated
instance id for the key.  The idea was to store JSON as the value which would then be distributed and acted
on the other systems.

## The thing with Distributed Systems...

As per usual with exercises that I attempt, I tend to bite off more than I can chew.

Distributed systems are far from simple beasts and while I think the general concept of leveldb as a journal store has merit it is 
something I lack both the time and grey matter to complete effectively.  If you are interested, then once
I started reading up on distributed systems (after mentally exploring some of the synchronization edge cases) 
there is quite a good [blog post on around which talks about CAP and a concept known as timeline consistency](http://dbmsmusings.blogspot.com/2010/04/problems-with-cap-and-yahoos-little.html).
As far as I can tell, this is kind of the concept I was shooting for.

For the moment I have abandoned the exercise (and I'm currently doing a [Redis](http://redis.io/) vs 
[Riak](http://wiki.basho.com/) vs [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) comparison - Riak's winning ATM). 
That, however, won't stop me showing you a little code integrating leveldb with NodeJS.

## To the Code

Talking to leveldb with NodeJS means writing NodeJS bindings to the underlying leveldb C++ library. Thankfully
[Tim Caswell](http://twitter.com/#!/creationix) had started the process with his [node-leveldb](https://github.com/creationix/node-leveldb)
project. Fantastic.  Let's have a look.

### Creating a Database

Creating a database is very simple process:

{% syntax javascript %}
var leveldb = require('node-leveldb');

// create the db
db = new leveldb.DB();
db.open({
    create_if_missing: true
}, 'changelog/db');
{% endsyntax %}

### Writing an Entry

Here is a snippet of code from the changelogger in our node stack:

{% syntax javascript %}
// create the entry key
var entryKey = microtime.now().toString(),
    value = 'test';

// ensure that the entry key is left-padded with 0s to 20 characters long
// this will ensure that entry added at time 1 is stored in the leveldb before time 123
entryKey = (new Array(20 - entryKey.length).join('0') + 1) + entryKey;

// add the additional entry key details
entryKey += delim + stack.id + delim + entryType;

// add to the db
db.put({}, new Buffer(entryKey), new Buffer(value));
{% endsyntax %}

### Iterating through the DB

As I mentioned earlier, leveldb is in fact a sorted key value store which means that you 
can iterate over the database in addition to plucking values in and out via a key. This is 
very handy and allows for the kind of use that I was intending.

An example of iterating over the db is shown below:

{% syntax javascript %}
var iterator = db.newIterator({});

for (iterator.seekToFirst(); iterator.valid(); iterator.next()) {
    console.log(iterator.key().toString());
} // for
{% endsyntax %}

__NOTE:__ At this stage, Tim's version of the `node-leveldb` project doesn't include support
for iterators but I had a crack at implementing them in [my own fork of the library](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/node-leveldb).

I have to say I was very impressed at how well iterators worked, and wrote a [simple test / demo](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/node-leveldb/blob/master/demo/iterator.js) 
(code below) to validate things were working as expected.  The demo requires the [node-uuid](https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid) as
keys are generated from uuids which demonstrates that the leveldb is quite effectively sorting.

{% syntax javascript %}
var DB = require('../build/default/leveldb.node').DB,
    uuid = require('node-uuid'),
    start = Date.now(),
    entryCount = 1000000,
    lastKey,
    readCount = 0,
    ii;

console.log("Creating test database");
var path = "/tmp/iterator.db";
var db = new DB();
db.open({create_if_missing: true}, path);

console.log('!! creating ' + entryCount + ' random key entries');
for (ii = 0; ii < entryCount; ii++) {
    var id = uuid();
    
    db.put({}, new Buffer(id), new Buffer(JSON.stringify({
        id: id,
        name: 'Bob',
        age: 33
    })));
} // for

console.log('created in ' + (Date.now() - start) + 'ms');
console.log('!! iterating db in key order');

// reset the start counter
start = Date.now();

// iterate over the test database
var iterator = db.newIterator({});

for (iterator.seekToFirst(); iterator.valid(); iterator.next()) {
    var key = iterator.key().toString('utf8');
    
    if (lastKey && lastKey > key) {
        console.log('found sorting error');
    } // if
    
    lastKey = key;
    readCount++;
} // for

console.log('read sequential ' + readCount + ' db contents in ' + (Date.now() - start) + 'ms');

// do some random seeking
for (ii = 0; ii < 100; ii++) {
    var testUUID = uuid();
    iterator.seek(new Buffer(testUUID));
    
    console.log('looking for first key after: ' + testUUID);
    
    // if we found something the report 
    if (iterator.valid()) {
        console.log('FOUND: ' + iterator.key());
    } // if
} // for

db.close();
DB.destroyDB(path, {});
{% endsyntax %}

Which yields something similar to the following:

{% endsyntax %}

### Reading Values from the DB

Reading values from the DB is essentially as simple as writing values to the db, and while 
I don't have any sample code from todays adventure.  You can find good examples in the original 
[node-leveldb demos](https://github.com/creationix/node-leveldb/tree/master/demo).

## LevelDB Restrictions 

There are a few restrictions when using leveldb (such as a db may only be safely opened by a single process
at a time), and having a read of some of the [docs in the leveldb source](http://leveldb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/)
is well worth your time.

Still for the asking price and the ease of use, it's a pretty impressive piece of kit and I look forward
to seeing what people do with it.
